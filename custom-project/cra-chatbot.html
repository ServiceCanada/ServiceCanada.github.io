maintenancePlan:
  - due: First release (for v1.0)
    what: Apply SRI to the webchat javascript
    rationale: Considering this is an external, non-gc CDN, we need to ensure the integrity of those files
  - due: Next release (v1.1 or v1.0.1)
    what: Update to latest webchat v4.13.0 (released on 2021-04-05)
    rationale: According to change log, there is a lot of accessibility fixes since the version 4.9.1.
  - due: Next release or two (v1.1 +)
    what: Investigate and report for the replacement option for webchat.
    rationale: The webchat has not been updated since 2021 and the Github repository seems to be stale.
  - due: Next release or two (v1.1 +)
    what: Map the domain name "asuzewebsite" into a valid Canada.ca subdomain.
    rationale: Improve the trust and clearly identify that is content under our control
  - due: To be determined
    what: Code optimization
    rationale: See informal todos

observationNotes:
  - about: CRA chatbot token
