componentName: search-ui
sponsor: Francis Gorman, Principal Publisher, ESDC 

statusUpdate: 2025-05-22 - Working on release v1.6.0, which doesn't include 1 item from the maintenance plan (postponed to next release)

pages:
  examples:
    - title: List of all search page examples
      language: en
      path: https://servicecanada.github.io/search-ui/index.html

maintenancePlan:
  - due: Next release (v1.7 +)
    what: Remove the need for having a CSS file for common utilities, classes, etc. to be handled by GCWeb instead.
    rationale: CSS and templates should be handled by GCWeb instead of having new ones in this project.
  - due: Next release or two (v1.7 +)
    what: Revisit customEvent to potentially be scoped to the search-ui element instead of document
    rationale: This will optimize event listeners to be more specific
  - due: Next release or two (v1.8 +)
    what: Start to add automated testing for the search-ui code functional aspect. This could be unit testing or functional testing with pupetteer.
    rationale: There is no functional testing, only a code linter and basic syntax checker.
  - due: TBD
    what: Use GCWeb combobox for QS once available
    rationale: Use GCWeb available components as much as possible
  - due: TBD
    what: Update facets template in GCWeb once facets are implemented in search results
    rationale: Facets should match GCWeb reference implementation once available

todos:
  - Refactor the code to make it easier to understand it functional aspect
  - Add Expected output on test pages (HTML) and use Jekyll highlights
  - "Leverage wb core features instead of reinventing the wheel, such as for language of page and dates. For dates, native JS functions could be leveraged such as: toLocaleDateString"
  - Make IDs configurable for "suggestion", "result-list", "result-link", "query-summary", "pager"
  - "<strong>to validate, reported as completed</strong> Investigate #wb-land focus on Advanced search"
  - Move QS generic integration to GCWeb (JS & CSS)

output: false
