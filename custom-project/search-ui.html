sponsor: Francis Gorman, Principal Publisher, ESDC 

statusUpdate: 2025-05-22 - Working on release v1.6.0, which doesn't include 1 item from the maintenance plan (postponed to next release)

pages:
  examples:
    - title: List of all search page examples
      language: en
      path: https://servicecanada.github.io/search-ui/index.html

maintenancePlan:
  - due: Next release (v1.7 +)
    what: Remove the need for having a CSS file. Should be handled by GCWeb instead. Also, align search pages with new GCWeb template and/or define new GCWeb templates
    rationale: CSS and templates should be handled by GCWeb instead of having new ones in this project.
  - due: Next release or two (v1.7 +)
    what: Revisit customEvent to potentially be scoped to the search-ui element instead of document
    rationale: This will optimize event listeners to be more specific
  - due: Next release or two (v1.8 +)
    what: Start to add automated testing for the search-ui code functional aspect. This could be unit testing or functional testing with pupetteer.
    rationale: There is no functional testing, only a code linter and basic syntax checker.
  - due: "Next release (1.7.0) - COMPLETED"
    what:
      - "Must: Clean outdated search query from the local storage variable <code>__coveo.analytics.history</code>. At minimum an expiry date/time constraint must be applied."
    rationale: "Postponing to next release MAX, since the search vendor is still working on a viable solution which requires management approval on our side (through: https://jtickets.atlassian.net/browse/SR-543)"
  - due: Release v1.6.0 - COMPLETED
    what:
      - "Create demos/test that are illustrating all functionality. Like a demos that show all the possible configurable option."
      - "Manage API key over a session storage where it allow the tester to enter that key manually in a separate page"
    rationale: During the review of v1.4, we found that change/addition was made to un-demoed feature.
  - due: Release v1.5.0 or v1.4.1 - COMPLETED
    what: Enforce the line ending for CSS build to be linux line ending, especially when generating the distribution files
    rationale: Ensure that the windows build, linux build or mac build do produce the same binary file.

todos:
  - Refactor the code to make it easier to understand it functional aspect
  - Add Expected output on test pages (HTML) and use Jekyll highlights
  - "Leverage wb core features instead of reinventing the wheel, such as for language of page and dates. For dates, native JS functions could be leveraged such as: toLocaleDateString"
  - Make IDs configurable for "suggestion", "result-list", "result-link", "query-summary", "pager"
  - "<strong>to validate, reported as completed</strong> Investigate #wb-land focus on Advanced search"
  - Move QS generic integration to GCWeb (JS & CSS)

output: false
