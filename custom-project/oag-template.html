maintenancePlan:
  - due: Next release (for v1.1 or v1.0.1)
    what: Reduce number of includes necessary by adapting GCWeb's own includes
    rationale: Having many include overrides could increase the technical debt of this project. By adapting GCWeb Jekyll to leverage different parameters, we'll be able to minimize the need for include overrides.
  - due: Next release (for v1.1 or v1.0.1)
    what: "Add <code>&lt;title></code> and <code>&lt;xml></code> elements in SVG markup (ref: https://github.com/wet-boew/GCWeb/blob/master/sites/assets/sig-blk-en.svg?short_path=5922cb9)"
    rationale: SVG's should be of high quality

  - about: Main menu
    observation: Some main menu items do not have sub-menu items, which is not standard for the main menu.

todos:
